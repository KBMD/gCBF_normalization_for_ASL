\section{Material \& Methods}

\subsection{Study participants}
Twenty-one nondemented, nondepressed adults age 40–75 with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr (1967) stages 1–3),\cite{6067254} treated with a stable dose of levodopa but no dopamine agonists, participated in the study. One subject was excluded for movement, as discussed below. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are reported elsewhere.\cite{Black_2010}

\subsection{Subject behavior}
Each session included two perfusion MRI scans while the subject fixated a central crosshair surrounded by a circular checkerboard reversing at 8Hz and two control visual fixation scans with the crosshair but no checkerboard. \callout{Stephanie, check this next couple of sentences:} The data used here are drawn from a treatment study,\cite{Black_2010} but only from the scanning session on the placebo day before levodopa.
