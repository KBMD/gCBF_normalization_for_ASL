\section*{Authorship Note}
The real order will be Stewart, Koller, [...,] Black.

I am wondering about including Rebekka Matheson, L. B. Duvall, N. E. Henniger, T. Liou as authors since they worked on getting ASL going in the first place and/or on the cASL or pASL ``power analysis for `single-cycle' ASL fMRI'' projects for which so far there has been no publication. I would love your thoughts on that. Stephanie, you too. I guess I am leaning towards a ``no'' because after all they didn't really work on this analysis at all. I'm a little more positive about inviting Meghan C.: I'm sure she would be glad to part of this if we ask, and she at least did help collect all these data. 

Also I am thinking maybe we should ask Joel if he will read it, critique it, maybe suggest some references to the original PET CBF literature (which he knows more intimately than I do), and be a co-author. 

Authorea makes it possible to change the order of authors, but I haven't yet figured out how to preserve the links or update when a new author signs on. See the file authors\_backup.tex (click the folder icon, upper left) for info--renaming that file authors.tex will replace the current author list.
