\section*{Authorship Note}
The real order will be Stewart, Koller, Campbell, [?Perlmutter,] Black.

I am thinking maybe we should ask Joel if he will read it, critique it, maybe suggest some references to the original PET CBF literature (which he knows more intimately than I do), and be a co-author. 
\verb|Jon? Your opinion on this please?|

Authorea makes it possible to change the order of authors, but I haven't yet figured out how to preserve the links or update when a new author signs on. See the file authors\_backup.tex (click the folder icon, upper left) for info---renaming that file authors.tex will replace the current author list.
