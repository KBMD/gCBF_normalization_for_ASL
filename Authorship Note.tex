\section{Authorship Note}
The real order will be Stewart, Koller, [...,] Black.

Authorea makes it possible to change the order of authors, but I haven't yet figured out how to preserve the links or update when a new author signs on. See the file authors\_backup.tex (click the folder icon, upper left) for info--renaming that file authors.tex will replace the current author list.
