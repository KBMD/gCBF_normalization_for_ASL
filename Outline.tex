Bottom line:

Shifting improves positive control effect (in check and 2 back) as compared to unshifted or proportional scaling images, as assessed:
\begin{itemize}
\item By histogram
\item By image quality: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item visual inspection;
  \item GM:WM blood flow ratio
  \end{itemize}
\item By V1 VOI: mean change (hard to judge) and t-test (shift50 is slightly better than mult50 or unshifted)
\item By SPM (shift50 is much better than unshifted, but it's debatable which of the shifts is better)
\end{itemize}
