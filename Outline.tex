Bottom line:

Shifting improves positive control effect (in check and 2 back) as compared to unshifted or proportional scaling images, as assessed:
1. By histogram
2. By image quality 
a. (visual inspection) 
b. (GM:WM blood flow ratio)
3. By mean change (hard to judge) and by t-test (slightly better than mult50 or unshifted)
4. By SPM  (much better than unshifted, debatable which of the shifts is better)
