\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1-2 sentence summary of hypoth/results
\item image intensity distributions and visual inspection of images (and hopefully GM:WM ratios) make it clear that additive correction (shift50) is clearly better than multiplicative correction (mult50) for making the images look like what they should and have numerical values close to what they should be
\item shift50 did improve stats
\item (?) a previous study showed high correlation of gCBF by ASL vs dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging, so multiplicative correction for ASL may often work as desired.\cite{Knutsson_2010}
\item we already knew gCBF correction would help with stats (cite our 2 posters),\cite{22789842} but it's nice to know it works as it should using additive correction
\item the task effect was surprisingly robust to the choice of shift5 or mult50; the good news there is that results previously reported using  mult50 correction are reasonably trustworthy
\item \sout{not sure whether to comment on how this is reminiscent of but quite different from the old SPM question about proportional scaling vs ANCOVA--for one thing, that is a question on a voxel level, and for another the underlying images should look like CBF images if possible ... I'd be inclined to leave it out}
\end{itemize}
