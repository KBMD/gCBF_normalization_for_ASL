\section{Results}

\sout{Shifting improves the positive control results (in the flickering checkerboard task) as compared to unshifted or proportional scaling images, as assessed in each of the following ways:}

\subsection{Voxel intensity distribution (histogram)}

\subsection{Image quality}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item visual inspection;
  \item GM:WM blood flow ratio
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Task activation: \textit{a priori} volume of interest}
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item mean change (hard to judge) and 
    \item t-test (shift50 is slightly better than mult50 or unshifted)
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Task activation: statistical image}
\sout{By SPM (shift50 is much better than unshifted, but it's debatable which of the shifts is better)}
