\section{Results}

Bottom line results:  Shifting improves the positive control results (in the flickering checkerboard task) as compared to unshifted or proportional scaling images, as assessed in each of the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item By histogram
\item By image quality: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item visual inspection;
  \item GM:WM blood flow ratio
  \end{itemize}
\item By V1 VOI: 
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item mean change (hard to judge) and 
    \item t-test (shift50 is slightly better than mult50 or unshifted)
  \end{itemize}
\item By SPM (shift50 is much better than unshifted, but it's debatable which of the shifts is better)
\end{itemize}


Frontiers requires figures to be submitted individually, in the same order as they are referred to in the manuscript. Figures will then be automatically embedded at the bottom of the submitted manuscript. Kindly ensure that each table and figure is mentioned in the text and in numerical order. Permission must be obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including the web). Please note that it is compulsory to follow figure instructions. Figures which are not according to the guidelines will cause substantial delay during the production process.

\caption{Resolution Requirements for the figures\label{Tab:02}}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
Image Type & Description & Format & Color Mode & Resolution\\
Line Art & An image composed of lines and text,  & TIFF, JPEG & RGB, Bitmap & 900 - 1200 dpi\\
           & which does not contain tonal or shaded areas.& & &\\
           Halftone & A continuous tone photograph, which contains no text. & TIFF, EPS, JPEG & RGB, Grayscale & 300 dpi\\
Combination & Image contains halftone + text or line art elements. & TIFF, JPEG & RGB,Grayscale & 600 - 900 dpi\\

\textbf{Table \ref{Tab:02}} shows the resolution requirements for the figures. The figures must be legible:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The smallest visible text is no less than 8 points in height, when viewed at actual size.
\item Solid lines are not broken up.
\item Image areas are not pixelated or stair stepped.
\item Text is legible and of high quality.
\item Any lines in the graphic are no smaller than 2 points width.
\item The actual size of the figure must be of at least 8.5 cm.
\end{enumerate}
