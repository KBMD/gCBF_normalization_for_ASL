\section*{Supplemental Data}

\subsection{Suppl. Fig. 1: Calculating the idealized mode}
The figure shows the frequency histogram for one of the CBF images. With this bin width, the mode falls at 32 (31.5--32.5), but the mean of the distribution, and the vertex of the parabola shown, both fall at about 35.0. 

\verb|Stephanie, please remake this figure, if needed, to show the current method (width of section currently fit to parabola)|

\subsection{Suppl. ##: Output from SPM software for task activation}
\verb|Stephanie, can you please write a short description of the SPM analyses here?|

\verb|We will separately upload the SPMs to the manuscript submission web site as a single merged PDF file.|
