The 63 frames of the ASL run were rigidly aligned using a validated method (Black et al., 2001) and summed to facilitate later alignment steps. Each frame was smoothed using a Gaussian filter with kernel measuring 7.35 mm (FWHM), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was computed in each voxel for each tag-control pair (Wang et al., 2003). The summed within-run-aligned EPI images were mutually aligned within each subject and summed, and the resulting image was affine registered to a target image in Talairach and Tournoux space made using validated methods from the structural MR images from these subjects (Black et al., 2004). From this registration, the 31 tag-control-pair CBF images were resampled into atlas space using matrix multiplication to avoid multiple resampling steps, and averaged to create a single atlas-registered CBF image for each ASL run. 
Performed motion censoring as per Power et al. One subject was excluded after motion data indicated that there was motion artifact in over 50? percent of frames.
