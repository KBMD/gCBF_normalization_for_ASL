\label{fig:smoothed_mode} The figure shows the frequency histogram for one of the CBF images. With this bin width, the mode falls at \approx32 (frequency=900, bin including all voxels with values 31.5--32.5), but the mean of the distribution, and the vertex of the parabola shown, both fall at about 35.0.
