\label{fig:rgb_figure} The effect of multiplicative or additive intensity normalization on 3 ASL scans (represented by red, blue and green) from a single subject. Top row: before normalization, middle row: after multiplicative normalization, bottom row: after additive normalization. The grayscale range for images on the top row is 0-75ml/hg/min, and is 0-100ml/hg/min for the middle and bottom rows. The first column shows frequency histograms of the voxel values across the brain for each of the 3 scans. The remaining columns show the same transverse slice in atlas space from the 3 scans; the image in the 2nd column corresponds to the histogram points marked in blue, and similarly the 3rd column red and the 4th column green.
